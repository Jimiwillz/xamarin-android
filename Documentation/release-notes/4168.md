### Stop generating Resource.designer.fs files for F# projects

Generation of F# resource files is no longer supported. F# projects will
now generate `Resource.designer.cs` files, which should be processed by the
[Xamarin.Android.FSharp.ResourceProvider][0] [NuGet Package][1]. Please
see [this sample code][2] as an example of how to use this Resource Provider.
This provider does not support processing of `Resource.designer.cs` files in
the intermediate output directory. The corresponding feature which is 
controlled by the `AndroidUseIntermediateDesignerFile` msbuild property has
been disabled for F# projects as a result.
